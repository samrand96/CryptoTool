About Programming
-
The project is whole writting with Java programming language, it contains the package;
1- cryptotool (Main): it is the root package of the project it contains CryptoTool class which is the main class!
2- cryptotool->ui: it is the child of cryptotool package it contains five classes all made by NetBeans GUI Designer; 
a- UserInterface: it's the main frame of the project, it's the JFrame or the Window of the program user interface. (JFrame)
b- Home: it's the panel of home section of the program.	(JPanel)
c- Encryption: it's the panel of encryption section of the program. (JPanel)
d- About: it's the panel of about section of the program. (JPanel)
e- Help: it's the panel of help section of the program. (JPanel)
3- cryptotool->algorithm: it is the child of root package this package contains the algorithm of encryption, my project was on RC4 - Stream cipher algorithm! it contains RC4 class.

How to use: 
-
Open the program, Select your algorithm click Next, then enter plain text and key then press encryption to encrypt it to you! note that the plain text and the key must be either contain alphabet (small letter only) and number and whitespace! and your key must be 4 or more, you can click refresh to clear the text fields and done to return to home section, we have also about section that talks about credits of the program and the version, and help section help you use the program!

Tests :
-

Plain text: "samrand mahmood"
Input key: "sami"
Cipher text: "oey 140rvyih3xx"
P.S.: you can test whether this cipher text is correct or not by using the cipher text as plain text and using the same key "sami" it should give you the same output as the first time plain text "samrand mahmood".
